# The Game

## Overview

In our first project, let's start out with something fun - **a game**!
Specifically, We'll be making **Tic Tac Toe**, a game that takes seconds to
learn but minutes to master!

By the time you submit this project, you will have covered new ground in many of
the big themes of the course:

-   **Command Line**: Interacting with the computer and navigating the
    filesystem from the command line.
-   **Source Control**: Managing and interacting with a git repository to store
    changes to code.
-   **Programming Fundamentals**: Working with objects, constructors, and
    events, while learning how to strategically solve problems and resolve
    errors.
-   **Web Fundamentals**:  Structuring, styling, and animating documents within
    a browser; responding to actions your users take and the data they input
    into the browser.
-   **Browser Applications**: Using AJAX to connect to a back-end application.
-   **Server Applications**:  We haven't covered a ton of server-side
    technologies yet (that's up next), but we learned a bit about how API
    endpoints work, and how to get data from them.
-   **Security**: With JavaScript closures, scratching the surface of why
    security matters.
-   **Deployment**: Host a static web site in a managed hosting environment
    (GitHub Pages)
-   **Products and Teams**: Document your code and your code repository so
    others understand what you've built.

At a high level, here are our goals for you in this project:

-   **Build a web application from scratch**, without a starter codebase
-   Use your programming skills to **map out the game logic for a simple game
    like Tic Tac Toe**
-   **Separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files** in your application
-   Build an application **to a spec that someone else gives you**
-   **Build a dynamic game that allows two players to compete** (bonus: compete
    from separate devices)
-   **Craft a ``readme.md`` file that explains your app** to the world
-   **Communicate with a back-end** (which we'll provide for you) to store the
    state of your game.

You will be working individually for this project, but we'll be guiding you
along the process and helping as you go. Everyone will get a chance to **be
creative**, and work through some really **tough programming challenges** to get
your feet wet in the world of web development. Those who dare will have the
tools to make it **multi-player, and multi-device** – so you can say to someone,
"hand me your phone," load up the game, and play a quick round!

## Deliverables

When you present your project, you must hand in the following things

-   A **working browser game, built by you**, hosted on GitHub Pages (or an
    alternative platform).
-   A **git repository hosted on Github**, with a link to your hosted game, and
    frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project
-   **A ``readme.md`` file** with explanations of the technologies used, the
    approach taken, unsolved problems, etc.
-   A **link to your hosted working game** in the URL section of your Github
    repo
-   Links to **wireframes and user stories**, preferably in the README of your
    repo.

In order to get a satisfactory score, your app must:

-   **Be deployed online**, where the rest of the world can access it
-   **Render a game board in the browser**
-   **Switch turns** between X and O (or whichever markers you select)
-   **Visually display which side won** if a player gets three in a row or show
    a draw/"cat’s game" if neither wins
-   Use **jQuery** for **DOM manipulation** and **event handling**
-   Use **AJAX** for data storage and retrieval
-   Have **login**, **logout**, and **change password** functionality
-   **Visually display** the results of retrieving game information
-   **Create** and **Update** games.

In addition, you must use separate files for your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and
(where possible) use semantic markup for your HTML. And in general, try to stick
with **KISS (Keep It Stupidly Simple)** and **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**
principles.

## Bonus

Once (and only once) you've satisfied the core requirements, here are some
additional goals that you can shoot for:

-   If allowing players to compete from separate devices, **display a
    "Waiting..." message** while users are waiting to be matched
-   Keep track of **multiple game rounds** with a win counter
-   Allow players to **customize their tokens** (X, O, name, picture, etc)
-   **Get inventive with your styling**, e.g. use hover effects or animations to
    spiff things up
-   Add **tableside chat** to your game
-   **Use localStorage** to persist data locally, allowing games to continue
    after page refresh or loss of internet connectivity

## Feedback

These are the things that consultants will be looking at, and giving you
feedback on, after you've submitted your project.

### Project Workflow

-   **Planning** : Did you complete user stories and wireframes before you
    started writing code? Did you create a schedule for yourself to keep your
    project on track?

-   **Source Control** : Did you use source control to keep track of changes in
    your project and make regular 'save points' for yourself?

### Deliverables

-   **Technical Requirements** : Does your project meet all the technical
    requirements outlined above? Does it run?
-   **Software Design/Problem Solving** : How did you break up the functionality
    of your application? How did you solve the problems that you encountered
    along the way? Do the solutions you came up with make sense, from the
    perspective of industry best practices? How well can you defend the choices
    you've made?
-   **Code Clarity** : Did you follow code style guidance and best practices
    covered in class, such as spacing and semantic naming? Did you comment your
    code as your s as we have in class?
-   **Creativity** : Did you added a personal spin or creative element into your
    project submission? Is the finished product something of value to the end
    user, in addition to being functional (not just a login button and an index
    page)?

## Overall Score

Your consultants will give you a total score on your project as an aggregate
across all the categories:

| Score | Expectations                                           |
|-------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **0** | _Does not meet expectations._                          |
| **1** | _Meets expectactions, good job!_                       |
| **2** | _Exceeds expectations, you magnificent creature, you!_ |

This will serve as a helpful overall gauge of whether you met the project goals.
But more important than your overall score is your feedback, particularly in
individual categories - this will help you identify where to focus your efforts
for future projects.

## Getting Started

Most importantly, remember to **go slowly and be methodical**. That means you
should be testing your changes in-browser as you write each line or so of code.
Always be commiting. Deploy early and often.

Here's a rough sketch of what you should do and in what order:

1.  [ ] Sketch some rough wireframes for how the front end will look and act.
1.  [ ] Write out some user stories for the app. User stories are short of how a
    user interacts with your app, and follows the format "As a `<role>`, I want
    to `<do something>`, so that `<some goal>`.
1.  [ ] Model the entities in your app. Draw a diagram. Use your wireframes and
    user stories to drive you modeling process by asking "What 'things' are a
    user interacting with?"
1.  [ ] Create a repo that your project will use, and add a README to it.
1.  [ ] Create a simple front-end with HTML and CSS, and host the front end on
    GitHub Pages. Use your wireframes to guide your layout.
1.  [ ] Create the code to manage your game logic.
1.  [ ] Write jQuery code to handle browser interaction.
1.  [ ] Start communicating with the back-end using `curl`. Use this to begin
    writing your AJAX code.
1.  [ ] Add any additional features to your app.
1.  [ ] Finish your documentation. Make it high-quality.

## Tips

-   **Break the project down into different components** (data, presentation,
    style, DOM manipulation) and brainstorm each component individually. Use
    whiteboards!
-   **Use your Development Tools** (console.log, debugger, alert statements,
    etc) to debug and solve problems.
-   Work through the lessons in class, **ask questions and schedule a 1on1**
    when you need to. Think about adding relevant code to your Tic Tac Toe game
    each night, instead of, you know... _procrastinating_.
-   **Commit early, commit often.** Don’t be afraid to break something because
    you can always go back in time to a previous version.
-   **Read documentation** (jQuery especially) at home to better understand hwo
    the tools you're using work.
-   **Don’t be afraid to write code that you know you will have to remove
    later.** Create temporary elements (buttons, links, etc) that trigger events
    if real data is not available. For example, if you’re trying to figure out
    how to change some text when the game is over but you haven’t solved the
    win/lose game logic, you can create a button to simulate that until then.
